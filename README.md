# Bear Tracker App

This is a simple app to display a few features with google maps, geolocation and an auto comlplete api

The app was a little difficult because I couldn't enable billing on my google cloud platform so i was restricted from a lot of features. Most annoying of which was the auto complete feature. I had to opt for a free plan from geoapify and I have a lot of limits on my requests so I had to slow down the auto complete feature to not overload the api and get too many requests rejected, so there is a bit of a lag

The app is NOT responsive so don't try it on your phone please :)
